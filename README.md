# videoboard

Simple http server for visualizing videos and images.

Videoboard launches a http server which recursively searches directories and shows all videos and images grouped by directory.
It supports videos and images with extensions `mp4`, `png`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, and `gif`.

> This repo is initiated to check training and testing results for Reinforcement Learning research. <br>
> Using Python's SimpleHTTPServer requires me to navigate forward and backward. 
> It is especially annoying when multiple experiments are running. <br>
> Videoboard makes visualizing videos from multiple directories much easier.
